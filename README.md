# This repo is not ready, yet
Things to do:
- Make sure latest versions are used with NPM
- Clean up webpack config?
- Make sure modules required by webpack are included in package.json
- Form icons are messed up, maybe include more icon sets?

# Start application
Run via the CLI
```
npm install
```
```
npm run start
```
Find out which modules are missing... Then a couple more:
```
npm install missing-module
```
Then a couple more tries at:
```
npm run start
```
